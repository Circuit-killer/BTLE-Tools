Bluetooth Smart Tool
====================

This is a testing and debugging tool for developers that create Bluetooth Low Energy) (a.k.a. Bluetooth Smart) devices. We developed this tool out of our own need and it proved to be of great help in the development process. 

It allows you to scan for Bluetooth Smart devices in the vicinity, read out the broadcasted data, and connect to them. The app allows you to test the following features of a Bluetooth Smart device: 

- The GAP (generic access profile) 
- Services offered by the device with names based on BT spec or vendor specific UUIDs 
- Characteristics of the services with names based on BT spec or vendor specific UUIDs 
- Reading values of the characteristics (with live updating) 
- Writing values to characteristics 
- Registering for notifications of characteristics 
- Connect to multiple peripherals at the same time
